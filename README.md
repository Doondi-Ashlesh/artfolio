Artfolio

Artfolio is a personal art portfolio website designed to showcase original artwork in a clean, modern, and visually focused way.
This project was created as a dedicated platform for my brother to present his creative work professionally online.

The goal of Artfolio is simple: let the art speak for itself through minimal distractions, smooth navigation, and a gallery-first design.
